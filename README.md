# Webpage Built with GSAP, HTML, and CSS

This is a simple webpage I created using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for animations and HTML/CSS for the layout and design. The purpose of this project was to practice my frontend development skills and explore the capabilities of GSAP for creating smooth and interactive animations.

## Features

- GSAP-powered animations to enhance user experience.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Simple and clean layout to showcase the power of GSAP.

## Usage

After obtaining the project files, you can customize and modify the webpage as per your requirements:

- **HTML:** The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the basic structure of the webpage. You can add, remove, or modify content based on your project needs.

- **CSS:** The CSS file (`styles.css`) includes the styles and layout for the webpage. Feel free to customize colors, fonts, and other design elements to match your project's branding.
